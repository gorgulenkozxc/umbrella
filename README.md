# What is going on here?
This is place where I put the lua scripts I wrote for [umbrella cheat](https://uc.zone/)
## [autoGhost](https://github.com/gorgulenkozxc/umbrella/blob/master/autoGhost.lua)
When enemy PA uses strike on you, script'll automatically use ghost. Made solely by [request](https://uc.zone/threads/dodger-auto-use-ghost-scepter-with-phantom-assassin.6022)
## [autoMessage](https://github.com/gorgulenkozxc/umbrella/blob/master/autoMessage.lua)
Works in two modes: at the end of the game and when killing another player. In killing mode, the script writes various offensive phrases into the chat room in order to demoralize
## [exp](https://github.com/gorgulenkozxc/umbrella/blob/master/exp.lua)
Shows how much experience is around you (forest and line creeps), and also has a color indication when you steal experience your allies.
## ~~[pudgeHooks](https://github.com/gorgulenkozxc/umbrella/blob/master/pudgeHooks.lua)~~ (already available in cheat)
Adds points to the world, that show the places where you can block the enemy after hook
## [showBkb](https://github.com/gorgulenkozxc/umbrella/blob/master/showBkb.lua)
Makes the BKB badge more visible by placing it under the enemy hero model. Badge is shown only when BKB is ready to use
## [towerGlyph](https://github.com/gorgulenkozxc/umbrella/blob/master/towerGlyph.lua)
Scripts adds a timer next to the tower, which shows how much time is left until the end of the glyph. Also can automatically last hit the tower. Made solely by [request](https://uc.zone/threads/request-fortified-remaining-duration-and-auto-last-hit-tower.6150)
## [nyxDamage](https://github.com/gorgulenkozxc/umbrella/blob/master/nyxDamage.lua)
Calculates damage from attack, impale, mana burn, vendetta and dagon considering enemy armor and magic resists
## [CMRadius](https://github.com/gorgulenkozxc/umbrella/blob/master/CMRadius.lua)
Uses a console command to draw the range of the Freezing Field
